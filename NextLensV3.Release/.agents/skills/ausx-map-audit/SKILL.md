# Auspex Map Audit

## Overview

This skill validates LENS/BMAD feature archives and living ledgers against the Auspex Two-Tree knowledge model. Act as a topology governance reviewer: distinguish blocking inconsistencies from advisory cleanup, protect authored truth from generated projections, and produce a report that can guide a projection rebuild or downstream reporting snapshot.

## On Activation

Load available config from `{project-root}/_bmad/config.yaml`, `{project-root}/_bmad/config.user.yaml`, `{project-root}/_bmad/config.toml`, and `{project-root}/_bmad/config.user.toml`, checking both root values and the `ausx` or `modules.ausx` section. If config is missing, let the user know `ausx-setup` can configure Auspex at any time. Use these defaults:

- `feature_archive_path`: `{project-root}/docs/features`
- `landscape_root`: `{project-root}/docs`
- `reporting_output_path`: `{project-root}/_bmad-output/auspex`
- `freshness_threshold_hours`: `24`

Support interactive, yolo, and headless use. In headless mode, infer paths from config/defaults, write the report, and return compact JSON with `status`, `report_path`, `blocking_count`, `advisory_count`, and `projection_rebuild_ready`.

## Source Model

Audit Markdown and YAML-bearing artifacts under the feature archive and landscape root. Treat frontmatter as canonical when present. Recognize these metadata keys when available: `stable_id`, `entity_type`, `title`, `belongs_to`, `status`, `updated_at`, `source_feature`, `promotion_status`, `salmon_upstream`, `links`, and `replaces`.

The living tree is the service/domain/program ledger structure, typically `{project-root}/docs/<program>/<domain>/<service>/ledger/` or a shallower landscape path. The feature tree is `{feature_archive_path}/<feature-id>/` and remains the permanent historical record. Derived governance maps are projections and must not be treated as authored truth.

## Audit Lens

Classify findings as:

- **Blocking:** duplicate `stable_id`, missing stable IDs on governed entities, broken `belongs_to` references, cycles in parentage, parent/entity type mismatches, broken local links, completed features whose required ledger target cannot be resolved, or contradictions that would make a projection rebuild unsafe.
- **Advisory:** stale `updated_at` values beyond `freshness_threshold_hours`, incomplete optional metadata, completed-but-unpromoted feature knowledge with an otherwise clear target, absent `source_feature` breadcrumbs, or report formatting issues that do not change the map.

Use "unknown" instead of guessing when metadata is absent. Do not fabricate parentage or stable IDs to make the map look complete.

## Workflow

First identify the audit scope and whether the user wants Markdown only or an HTML-capable report. If a previous Auspex audit exists in `reporting_output_path`, use it only as comparison context; re-read current source artifacts before judging.

Inventory governed entities by stable ID, file path, entity type, status, parent reference, and outbound links. Build an in-memory parent graph from `belongs_to`, then check duplicate IDs, missing parents, orphaned nodes, cycles, invalid local links, and source feature references. Separately scan completed feature archives for promotion signals and stale living ledgers for freshness warnings.

Produce `{reporting_output_path}/map-audit-{date}.md`. If HTML-capable output is requested, write Markdown that can be rendered directly: stable headings, tables, anchors, severity badges as text, and no source write-backs. Include a fenced `json` summary block for Auspex UI ingestion.

## Report Contract

The report must include:

- Scope, source paths, timestamp, and config values used
- Executive verdict: `PASS`, `PASS_WITH_ADVISORIES`, or `BLOCKED`
- Projection rebuild readiness with the exact blocking reasons when false
- Blocking findings table with stable ID, path, problem, impact, and recommended fix
- Advisory findings table with the same fields
- Entity inventory grouped by program, domain, service, feature, and unknown
- Completed-but-unpromoted feature list
- Broken link and orphan appendix
- Machine-readable summary block:

```json
{
  "module": "ausx",
  "report_type": "map_audit",
  "blocking_count": 0,
  "advisory_count": 0,
  "projection_rebuild_ready": true
}
```

## Safety Rules

This workflow is read-only. Never edit feature archives, ledgers, generated projections, or config files. If the audit reveals an obvious fix, describe the patch in the report instead of applying it.
